# Tips and Tricks

## Tips for Developers

* **You** are the primary reviewer / first line of defense
* Don't take feedback personally. Assume positive intent.
* Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
* You can always learn more. Listen and respect the advice and opinions of others.
* No unilateral changes. You are part of a team. Code rewrites should be by group consensus through PRs / CRs.
* Obligation to dissent. Speak up and let your opinion be known. However, be respectful and gracefully accept if the team decides to go another way.
* Split out brainstorming, problem solving, and review meetings. They are not one and the same.

## Tips for Reviewers

* Critique code, not coders. Be respectful and kind to the developer and make sure to provide constructive criticism.
* Comment on positives as well as areas that need improvement.
* Be respectful to those less experienced and/or knowledgable.
* Seniority does not make you right.
* It's ok to ask questions if you are unsure of something.
* Split out brainstorming, problem solving, and review meetings. They are not one and the same.
* There are many ways to skin a cat. Be open minded about the developer's solution.
* Be timely but thorough with your review.
