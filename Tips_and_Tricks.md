# Tips and Tricks

## Tips for Developers

* **You** are the primary reviewer / first line of defense
* Don't take feedback personally. Assume positive intent.
* Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
* You can always learn more. Listen and respect the advice and opinions of others.
* No unilateral changes. You are part of a team. Code rewrites should be by group consensus through PRs / CRs.
* Obligation to dissent. Speak up and let your opinion be known. However, be respectful and gracefully accept if the team decides to go another way.
* Split out brainstorming, problem solving, and review meetings. They are not one and the same.
* Explicit is better than implicit. "Clever" code can sometimes mean unnecessarily complicated.
* Trade of level of effort (LOE) and utility. If you can cut scope without impacting core features, do it.
* Prototype rapidly. Don't be afraid to fail. Failing is usually the quickest path to learning.
* Automate if you can.
* Open source over proprietary. 
* Solve the root cuase of the bug. Don't jsut treat the symptoms. 
* Derisk when possible. Consistent and reliable delivery is important for team delivery.
* PLAN AHEAD! Plan you code, research, lunch schedule, all of it.

## Tips for Reviewers

* Critique code, not coders. Be respectful and kind to the developer and make sure to provide constructive criticism.
* Comment on positives as well as areas that need improvement.
* Be respectful to those less experienced and/or knowledgable.
* Seniority does not make you right.
* It's ok to ask questions if you are unsure of something.
* Split out brainstorming, problem solving, and review meetings. They are not one and the same.
* There are many ways to skin a cat. Be open minded about the developer's solution.
* Be timely but thorough with your review.
